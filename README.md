### üéâ Contribution Guidelines
- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read this).
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (Check this for more info)
- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a text in button, minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at here)
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
- Please follow the PR Template to create the PR.
- Always create PR to develop branch.
- Please read our Code of Conduct.
